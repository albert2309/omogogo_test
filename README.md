# omogogo_test

This is an incomplete submission for a challenge made by Omogogo. I used Django as my main framework because I decided to challenge myself further with the help of automated test. I was able to create a model that's similar to data structure that I presented in `example.json`. However, I could not finish the test on time, so I decided to concede.

To run this, you can just write `py manage.py runserver` on the command line.

You can see the list of framework and library that I used in `requirements.txt`
